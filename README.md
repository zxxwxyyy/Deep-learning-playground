## ðŸ’» **Deep-learning-playground**

Welcome to my deep learning playground! This repository is a collection of various projects where I have explored and applied concepts from the fascinating realm of machine learning and deep learning. You will find comprehensive data analyses, insights derived from different models, and a demonstration of various machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to both structured and unstructured data.

## **Current projects**

1. [**Titanic Competion**](https://github.com/zxxwxyyy/Deep-learning-playground/blob/main/Predict_titanic_surviver.ipynb) ðŸš¢

    This project is centered around the legendary Titanic machine learning competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal is to predict the survival of the passengers on the Titanic, which sank in 1912. This project demonstrates a blend of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes on this historical dataset.

2. [**Age Sex Prediction**](https://github.com/zxxwxyyy/Deep-learning-playground/blob/main/age_sex_prediction.ipynb) ðŸ‘´ðŸ§‘

    This is a deep learning project based on the curriculum of [World-of-ML](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified). In this project, I built and trained a convolutional neural network to predict the age and sex of individuals from their images. This project highlights the application of deep learning techniques on image data and demonstrates the steps involved in preprocessing image data for machine learning tasks.

3. [**Alzheimer Prediction**](https://github.com/zxxwxyyy/Deep-learning-playground/blob/main/alzheimer_prediction.ipynb) ðŸ©º
    
    Another deep learning project adopted from [World-of-ML](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified). The primary objective is to predict the stages of Alzheimer's disease using MRI scan images. This project showcases the potential of deep learning in the medical field for disease diagnosis and prognosis, and gives insights on how to handle and process medical imaging data.

4. [**Amazon Reviews Prediction**](https://github.com/zxxwxyyy/Deep-learning-playground/blob/main/Amazon_reviews.ipynb)

   This project is an exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Amazon product reviews. The aim is to predict the sentiment behind the reviews, classifying them as positive, neutral, or negative. This work is a testament to the power of deep learning and NLP in understanding and deriving insights from natural language data.
